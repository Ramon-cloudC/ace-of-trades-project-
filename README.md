This repo is dedicated to a challenge Project ( Codecademy ).

You will see how I divided the html in sections by commenting each one out. I tried to be as much as organised as possible and I also implemented some flex-box rules as well as some of the grid rules. Ultimately I applied a bunch of @media queries ( max-width: 480px ), to get the responsiveness that a website should have.
